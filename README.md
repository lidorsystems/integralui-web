## DEMO

[Online QuickStart App](https://www.lidorsystems.com/products/web/studio/samples/) - An online demo of each component included


## Installation

Install the repository by running

```bash
npm install https://github.com/lidorsystems/integralui-web.git
```

or directly from NPM

```bash
npm i integralui-web
```

<b>Note</b> A detailed information is available here: [How to Use IntegralUI Web Components](https://www.lidorsystems.com/help/integralui/web-components/introduction/installation/). Explains how to setup and use components for each framework: Angular, React or Vanilla JavaScript.

In general, you need to open your application and add a reference to a component you want to use. For example, if you are using the IntegralUI TreeView component:</p>

### Angular

```bash
import 'integralui-web/components/integralui.treeview.js';
```

Depending on current version of TypeScript, you may need to add some settings in tsconfig.json, under "angularCompilerOptions":

```bash"angularCompilerOptions": {

    . . .

    "suppressImplicitAnyIndexErrors": true,     // solves implicit any values
    "noImplicitAny": false,             // solves angular could not find a declaration file for module implicitly has an 'any' type
    "strictNullChecks": false           // solves type null is not assignable to type

}
```

### React

```bash
import IntegralUITreeViewComponent from 'integralui-web/wrappers/react.integralui.treeview.js';
```

<b>Note</b>   Currently [ReactJS doesn't have full support for Web Components](https://custom-elements-everywhere.com/#react). Mainly because of the way data is passed to the component via attributes and their own synthetic event system. For this reason, you can use available wrappers located under /wrappers directory, which are ReactJS components that provide all public API from an IntegralUI component.</p>

### Vanilla JavaScript

```bash
<script type="module" src="integralui-web/components/integralui.treeview.js"></script>
```


## Icons

Because of the web component specification that defines URLs to be always relative to the main document, the path that leads to the icons used by the IntegralUI Web components needs to be set. In addition you may also need to copy/paste the /icons folder in your application folder. Depending on the framework of your choosing this may differ.

### Angular

Follow these steps:
1. Copy/Paste the content of the integralui-web/icons folder under /assets/integralui-web/icons subfolder in your Angular application. 
2. Set the resourcePath property of IntegralUI Web components to point to the location set in your /assets folder. In this case, for TreeView for example:

```bash
<iui-treeview [resourcePath]="'assets/integralui-web/icons'"></iui-treeview>
```

### React

Follow these steps:
1. Copy/Paste the content of the integralui-web/icons folder under /public/integralui-web/icons subfolder in your React application. 
2. Set the resourcePath property of IntegralUI Web components to point to the location set in your /public folder. In this case, for TreeView for example:

```bash
<IntegralUITreeViewComponent resourcePath="integralui-web/icons"></IntegralUITreeViewComponent>
```

### Vanilla JavaScript

Set the resourcePath property of IntegralUI Web components to point to /integralui-web/icons folder. In this case, for TreeView for example:

```bash
<iui-treeview resource-path="../../integralui-web/icons"></iui-treeview>
```


## QuickStart App

There is a demo application with source code that contains samples for each component included in the IntegralUI Web library. It can help you to get started quickly with learning about the components and write tests immediatelly. 

From [IntegralUI Web - QuickStart](https://github.com/lidorsystems/integralui-web-quickstart) you can download a demo app for Angular, AngularJS, React and Vanilla JavaScript. A detailed information about each of these quick-start demos is available in ReadMe file, located in the root folder of the demo app.
